# RE_check

This program determines how many restriction sites are going to be introduced by deep mutational scanning. Deep mutational scanning 
goes along the entire length of a gene, changing each codon to NNN where N is every nucleotide. Here, you will generate each of those
permutations and check them against a provided restriction cut site.

To run the program, you need the following things:
* Text file with your sequence of interest - should be in frame (e.g. a multiple of 3)
* Codon from where you would like to start your scanning
* Output file name 
* Restriction cutsite sequence

Run the program with the following command:

python RE_check.py <sequencefile> <firstcodon> <outputfile> <cutsite>

For example, if I wanted to check the human DPP4 gene for the introduction of a SpeI site during deep mutational scanning
(starting at the first codon), I would run:

python RE_check.py hDPP4.txt 1 SpeI_hDPP4_sites.txt ACTAGT

The output file will contain the cutsite that was inputted, the number of cutsites that will be generated by deep mutation scanning,
the input file you provided, and then a list of the codon number and sequence that will result in a cutsite.

Files to test the hDPP4 example above, as well as the expected output, are provided.
